{"abstract": "AdaBoost algorithm based on Haar-like features can achieves high accuracy (above 95%) in object detection. Meanwhile massive computing power is needed to implement the cascaded classifiers involved in AdaBoost detection. To solve this problem, several dedicated hardware solutions have been proposed for real-time applications. In this work, a novel heterogeneous architecture of an AdaBoost detector is presented. This architecture achieves higher performance while consuming fewer hardware resources. By combining an integrated ARM Cortex-A9 processor with a dedicated accelerator, this architecture can be configured to realize various objects detection by simply loading different parameters. 2-D parallelism is involved in accelerator unit combination which brings more flexibility. This scheme is implemented on Xilinx ZC702 platform, the experiment result shows that 40 QVGA frames per second can be achieved for real-time face detection. The accelerator achieves more than 13 times improvement over the OpenCV implementation on a standalone Cortex-A9 w.r.t execution speed. Meanwhile, the accelerator consumes 40% less FPGA hardware resources than the prior-art implementation.", "authors": ["Zheng Xu", "Runbin Shi", "Zhihao Sun", "Yaqi Li", "Yuanjia Zhao", "Chenjian Wu"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["05944f08-b0df-47b8-bb44-23a63cf6a9a8", "1f4152a3-481f-4adf-a29a-2193a3d4303c", "3c2ddf0a-237b-4d17-8083-c90df5f3514b", "522ce553-29ea-4e0b-9ad3-0ed4eb9de065", "579e5f24-5b13-4e92-b255-0c46d066e306", "5d0b987d-eed9-42ce-9bf3-734d98824f1b", "80656b4d-b24c-4d92-8753-bdb965bcd50a", "d6e37fb1-5f7e-448e-847b-7d1f1271c574"], "title": "A Heterogeneous	System for Real-Time Detection with AdaBoost", "venue": "high performance computing and communications",	"year":	2016, "id": "001eef4f-1d00-4ae6-8b4f-7e66344bbc6e"}

{"abstract": "This paper studies the problem of using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to seek the source of some signal in the underwater environment. To avoid the redundant travels for getting the local gradient in existing methods, we propose a novel source-seeking strategy in which the AUV keeps updating an estimated field model using measurements along its gradient-climbing path. Based on the convergence results of the sequential least-squares field estimation algorithm and the path planning method by nonlinear programming, the AUV will finally reach a maximum of the field which indicates a potential source. The way-point tracking control of the AUV is realized by a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme embedded with the line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed source-seeking strategy is validated in the simulation experiment with a real AUV model.", "authors": ["Xiaodong Ai", "Keyou You", "Shiji Song"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["1862a08a-08c6-4ab1-a214-8932bbd0d2d9", "7bcea2f7-6006-4a4d-8529-3593fa56d2dc", "c1959b6f-8bab-49a2-ae2f-066c43cfc9c9", "d65d26b4-a0e0-4112-ae22-2f3a4b51d7b3", "e66104e4-31fd-43d6-a056-f52bf8ae7eee"], "title": "A source-seeking strategy for an autonomous underwater vehicle via on-line field estimation", "venue": "international conference on control, automation, robotics and vision", "year": 2016, "id": "00352759-f0a7-4678-82ae-fed68c700da6"}

{"abstract": "This paper presents a methodology to analyze linguistic changes in a given textual corpus allowing to overcome two common problems related to corpus linguistics studies. One of these issues is the monotonic increase of the corpus size with time and the other one is the presence of noise in the textual data. In addition, our method allows to better target the linguistic evolution of the corpus, instead of other aspects like noise fluctuation or topics evolution. A corpus formed by two newspapers, \"La Gazette de Lausanne\" and \"Le Journal de Gen\\`eve\", is used, providing 4 million articles from 200 years of archives. We first perform some classical measurements on this corpus in order to provide indicators and visualizations of linguistic evolution. We then define the concept of a lexical kernel and word resilience, to face the two challenges of noises and corpus size fluctuations.

{"abstract": "Boneh and Durfee (Eurocrypt 1999) proposed two polynomial time attacks on small secret exponent RSA. The first attack works when d  0.284  whereas the second attack works when d  0.292 . Both attacks are based on lattice based Coppersmith's method to solve modular equations. Durfee and Nguyen (Asiacrypt 2000) extended the attack to a variant of RSA where prime factors are not the same sizes. However, the attack extended only the first attack of the Boneh-Durfee. Hence, an open problem remains, i.e., if the Boneh-Durfee second attack can be extended to unbalanced RSA. In this paper, we propose a desired attack that extended the Boneh-Durfee second attack. Our proposed attack fully improves the Durfee-Nguyen attack for all size of prime factors. The improvement stems from our technical lattice construction. Although Durfee and Nguyen only analyzed lattices whose basis matrices are triangular, we analyze broader classes of lattices that contain non-triangular basis matrices. The analysis can be performed by using the unravelled linearization proposed by Herrmann and May (Asiacrypt 2009) and the transformation on the Boneh-Durfee lattices proposed by Takayasu and Kunihiro (PKC 2016). As a result, we can exploit useful algebraic structure compared with the Durfee-Nguyen.", "authors": ["Atsushi Takayasu", "Noboru Kunihiro"], "n_citation": 0, "title": "Small secret exponent attacks on RSA with unbalanced prime factors", "venue": "international symposium on information theory and its applications", "year": 2016, "id": "01537b60-9ae2-4684-a1fa-e688e7757e6f"}						
{"abstract": "Container identification and recognition is still performed manually or in a semi-automatic fashion in multiple ports globally. This results in errors and inefficiencies in port operations. The problem of automatic container identification and recognition is challenging as the ISO standard only prescribes the pattern of the code and does not specify other parameters such as the foreground and background colors, font type and size, orientation of characters (horizontal or vertical) so on. Additionally, the corrugated surface of container body makes the two dimensional projection of the text on three dimensional containers slanted and jagged. We propose a solution in the form of an end-to-end pipeline that uses Region Proposals generated based on Connected Components for text detection in conjunction with Spatial Transformer Networks for text recognition. We demonstrate via our experimental results that the pipeline is reliable and robust even in situations when the code characters are highly distorted and outperforms the state-of-the-art results for text detection and recognition over the containers.

{"abstract": "Metaheuristics, such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs), and hyper-heuristics have been widely studied and applied in the literature. This led to the development of several frameworks to aid the execution and development of such algorithms. Consequently, the reusability, scalability and maintainability became fundamental points to be attacked by developers. Such points can be improved using Design Patterns, but despite their advantages, few works have explored their usage with metaheuristics and hyper-heuristics. In order to contribute to this research topic, we present a solution based on the Visitor pattern used to design genetic operators. A case study is presented with the Hyper-heuristic for the Integration and Test Order problem (HITO).

{"abstract": "Betweenness centrality is a popular metric in social science, and recently it was adopted also in computer science. Betweenness identifies the node, or the nodes, that are most suitable to perform critical network functions, such as firewalling and intrusion detection. However, computing centrality is resource-demanding, we can not give for granted that it can be computed in real time at every change in the network topology. This is especially true in mesh networks that generally use devices with few computation resources. This paper shows that using the fastest state-of-the-art heuristic algorithm it is indeed possible to compute network centrality even in real, low-power networking hardware in a network made of up to 1000 nodes. Not only, observing the behavior of a real mesh network it shows that centrality does not need to be updated at every topology change, but it can be safely re-computed with an interval in the order of the tens of minutes. Our findings confirms that centrality can be effectively and successfully used as a building block for security functions in mesh networks.", "authors": ["Leonardo Maccari", "Quynh Nguyen", "Renato Lo Cigno"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["03a2eb6c-8a96-468e-b79f-282d069a4824", "063390a2-f032-473b-9806-db49733becdd", "1dc91e45-5985-4fd5-b62c-2b2df7c22b30", "22ea44eb-8d96-4bfc-aea4-94362672b98f", "28d2789b-7924-470a-9ec7-34363e00c975", "2c8e7e31-db3c-4207-8b28-ee8e2910dd87", "2ea644c7-5598-40fb-8afa-043ab2bfd529", "46adcb49-cb4d-4370-b0d2-50ec87f27cc9", "555fc5aa-69a3-473f-b7a3-2a2e69deb835", "631fa5b4-ccd0-4f8d-81dd-5b27fb10052b", "7b2e7ba1-1bb4-4d21-8120-fa84a27b6e84", "84d108d4-c2a5-4	531-9dcf-39ede987bccf", "a2f6bc97-abdd-4f23-b2d1-7f57fab1429c", "b233c983-a938-4aeb-a375-d2900d101d24", "	bb0cf3d2	-3c83-465e-81df-c7f1bf7c7bd8", "befe08a2-967a-4846-a16a-db0f74d190c5",	"c5	74452b-32	e8-41e6-9c62-a9d3b05a5e6b", "c97e6efd-0469-4fcd-af6e-d9093fbb598f", "d49d8c12-a22d-41cb-bbed-3c03afd255eb", "ddcbdf0b-7da1-4ec0-80dd-be302a5fa8c3"], "title": "On the Computation of Centrality Metrics for Network Security in Mesh Networks", "venue": "global communications conference", "year": 2016, "id": "055c731d-eead-439a-bec4-f2028968cc31"}

In this paper, we derive formula of traffic delay for RC flows in TTEthernet with intensive TT-schedule schema under the condition of preemption transmission mode, expand performance analysis scope to support multi-priority flows through assuming TT flow as the highest-priority RC flow when considering the pessimism of scheduling and verify the practicability of modified model by calculating its algorithmic complexity.

{"abstract": "Wheeled ground robots are limited from exploring extreme environments such as caves, lava tubes and skylights. Small robots that can utilize unconventional mobility through hopping, flying or rolling can overcome these limitations. Mul-tiple robots operating as a team offer significant benefits over a single large ro-bot, as they are not prone to single-point failure, enable distributed command and control and enable execution of tasks in parallel. These robots can complement large rovers and landers, helping to explore inaccessible sites, obtaining samples and for planning future exploration missions. Our robots, the SphereX, are 3-kg in mass, spherical and contain computers equivalent to current smartphones. They contain an array of guidance, navigation and control sensors and electronics. SphereX contains room for a 1-kg science payload, including for sample return. Our work in this field has recognized the need for miniaturized chemical mobility systems that provide power and propulsion. Our research explored the use of miniature rockets, including solid rockets, bi-propellants including RP1/hydrogen-peroxide and polyurethane/ammonium-perchlorate. These propulsion options provide maximum flight times of 10 minutes on Mars. Flying, especially hovering consumes significant fuel; hence, we have been developing our robots to perform ballistic hops that enable the robots to travel efficiently over long distances. Techniques are being developed to enable mid-course correction during a ballistic hop. Using multiple cameras, it is possible to reconstitute an image scene from motion blur. Hence our approach is to enable photo mapping as t	he robots travel on a ballistic hop. The same images would also be used for navigation and path planning.

{"abstract": "Fundamental tradeoffs in green cellular networks with coexistence of machine-oriented and human-oriented traffic are investigated. First, we present a queuing system to model the uplink transmission of a green base station which serves two types of distinct traffic with strict requirements on delay and battery lifetime. Then, the energy-lifetime and energy-delay tradeoffs are introduced, and closed-form expressions for energy consumption of the base station, average experienced delay in data transmission, and expected battery lifetime of machine devices are derived. Furthermore, we extend the derived results to the multi-cell scenario, and investigate the impacts of system and traffic parameters on the energy-lifetime and energy-delay tradeoffs using analytical and numerical results. Numerical results show the impact of energy saving for the access network on the introduced tradeoffs, and figure out the ways in which energy could be saved by compromising on the level of performance.", "authors": ["Amin Azari", "Guowang Miao"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["2eed0e90-d04b-4868-ae90-4dba91794542", "4d302826-cf75-4415-beb7-0b7f69bfe2a6", "75ff8e1a-4f62-4df7-8190-4b68cda69416", "7cdf9036-41b3-496e-a7fe-ca9f7858f6b9", "8c69d90c-4b18-4037-b17d-03c5672c2ed5", "99bb5ecc-47bd-4708-ab7c-5acd79291168", "aba4e267-b349-42f0-8e12-66734e4a0996"], "title": "Battery Lifetime-Aware Base Station Sleeping Control with M2M/H2H Coexistence", "venue": "global communications conference", "year": 2016, "id": "0794014e-c320-4aa7-99f8-bb1d34f86277"}						
{"abstract": "In this paper, we present a distributed economic dispatch strategy for a large-scale power system. At first, we treat each generator and load in the grid as an \"agent\". By decomposing the centralized optimization into optimizations at local agents, a scheme is proposed for each agent to iteratively estimate a solution of the optimization problem in a distributed manner. Due to the large number of the agents, the agents are sorted into several clusters and each cluster has a leader to communicate with the leaders of its neighboring clusters. The agents in the same cluster can conduct local optimization and communicate with its neighboring agents in parallel. After that, the leader agents of each cluster exchange their information simultaneously. It is shown that the estimated solutions of all the agents reach consensus of the optimal solution asymptomatically. Compared to our previous work in [14], where the leader agent in each cluster conducts the optimization in a sequential way, the proposed scheme in this paper allows them communicate and conduct optimization simultaneously, which greatly improves the algorithm efficiency.

{"abstract": "Massive Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (M-MIMO) system is a promising technology that offers to mobile networks substantial increase in throughput. In Time-Division Duplexing (TDD), the uplink training allows a Base Station (BS) to acquire Channel State Information (CSI) for both uplink reception and downlink transmission. This is essential for M-MIMO systems where downlink training pilots would consume large portion of the bandwidth. In densely populated areas, pilot symbols are reused among neighboring cells. Pilot contamination is the fundamental bottleneck on the performance of M-MIMO systems. Pilot contamination effect in antenna arrays can be mitigated by treating the channel estimation problem in angular domain where channel sparsity can be exploited. In this paper, we introduce a codebook that projects the channel into orthogonal beams and apply Minimum Mean-Squared Error (MMSE) criterion to estimate the channel. We also propose data-aided channel covariance matrix estimation algorithm for angular domain MMSE channel estimator by exploiting properties of linear antenna array. The algorithm is based on simple linear operations and no matrix inversion is involved. Numerical results show that the algorithm performs well in mitigating pilot contamination where the desired channel and other interfering channels span overlapping angle-of-arrivals.", "authors": ["Yihenew Dagne Beyene", "Kalle Ruttik", "Riku J\u00e4ntti"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["397d220e-8154-4729-b2e4-10af297c6da4", "99d4c119-b99d-4931-a343-dc048cd562ca", "a4f35f32-3bec-43f9-9570-81f6d8aedfeb", "ad93a8cf-7157-4e38-8028-6acf2850e67a"], "title": "Angular Dom	ain Data-Assisted Channel Estimation for Pilot Decontamination in Massive MIMO", "venue": "Mobile Informa	tion Sys	tems", "year": 2017, "id": "08005b30-d0de-4578-84a3-dafa9b34c787"}

{"abstract": "This paper addresses the synchronization and state estimation problems for an array of coupled discrete-time stochastic complex networks (SCNs) with uncertain inner couplings in which time-varying delay is considered both in the network couplings and dynamical nodes. In particular, the uncertainties encountering in coupling terms are characterized by using the interval matrix approach. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii functional and utilizing Kronecker product properties, a new set of sufficient conditions is established in terms of linear matrix inequalities to guarantee the synchronization of the addressed SCNs with a prescribed mixed  H  \u221e  and passivity performance index. Moreover, the state estimation problem is then studied for the same SCNs with uncertain inner coupling strength and subsequently, the estimator is designed. More precisely, Schur complement, discrete-time Jensen\u2019s inequality together with reciprocally convex combination approach are used to simplify the derivations in the main results. Finally, numerical examples are exploited to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization and state estimation results.", "authors": ["R. Sakthivel", "M. Sathishkumar", "B.

{"abstract": "Branch and bound is a well-known generic method for computing an optimal solution of a single-objective optimization problem. Based on the idea \u201cdivide to conquer\u201d, it consists in an implicit enumeration principle viewed as a tree search. Although the branch and bound was first suggested by Land and Doig (1960), the first complete algorithm introduced as a multi-objective branch and bound that we identified was proposed by Kiziltan and Yucaoglu (1983). Rather few multi-objective branch and bound algorithms have been proposed. This situation is not surprising as the contributions on the extensions of the components of branch and bound for multi-objective optimization are recent. For example, the concept of bound sets, which extends the classic notion of bounds, has been mentioned by Villarreal and Karwan (1981). But it was only developed for the first time in 2001 by Ehrgott and Gandibleux, and fully defined in 2007.#R##N##R##N#This paper describes a state-of-the-art of multi-objective branch and bound, which reviews concepts, components and published algorithms.

{"abstract": "Self-reconfigurable modular robots (SRMRs) have recently attracted considerable attention because of their numerous potential applications in the real world. In this paper, we draw a comprehensive comparison among five different algorithms in path planning of a novel SRMR system called ACMoD through an environment comprised of various terrains in a static condition. The contribution of this work is that the reconfiguration ability of ACMoD has been taken into account. This consideration, though raises new algorithmic challenges, equips the robot with new capability to pass difficult terrains rather than bypassing them, and consequently the robot can achieve better performance in terms of traversal time and energy consumption. In this work, four different optimization algorithms, including Adaptive Genetic Algorithm, Elitist Ant System, Dijkstra and Dynamic Weighting A*, along with a well-known reinforcement learning algorithm called Q-Learning, are proposed to solve this path planning problem. The outputs of these algorithms are the optimal path through the environment and the associated configuration on each segment of the path. The challenges involved in mapping the path planning problem to each algorithm are discussed in full details.

In this paper, we first conduct a detailed analysis on an HTM-based concurrent B+Tree, which uncovers several reasons for excessive HTM aborts induced by both false and true conflicts under contention. Based on the analysis, we advocate Eunomia, a design pattern for search trees which contains several principles to reduce HTM aborts, including splitting HTM regions with version-based concurrency control to reduce HTM working sets, partitioned data layout to reduce false conflicts, proactively detecting and avoiding true conflicts, and adaptive concurrency control. To validate their effectiveness, we apply such designs to construct a scalable concurrent B+Tree using HTM.

{"abstract": "Antenna switch enables multiple antennas to share a common RF chain, thus an additional spatial dimension, i.e., antenna index, can be utilized in the design of single RF chain MIMO and information can be conveyed via both signal space and spatial dimension. In this paper, we propose a unified adaptive transmission scheme - adaptive spatial modulation that allocates information into signal space and spatial dimension in order to maximize the overall channel capacity for single RF chain MIMO. The proposed adaptive spatial modulation is realized by using Huffman coding, i.e., designing variable length codes to activate the transmit antenna with different probabilities. The optimal antenna activation probability is derived through optimizing channel capacity. To make the optimization tractable, closed form upper bound and lower bound are derived as the effective approximations for channel capacity. Numerical results show that the proposed adaptive spatial modulation offers considerable performance improvement over both spatial modulation and transmit antenna selection.", "authors": ["Wei Wang", "Wei Zhang"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["19392837-7972-4aa7-a860-d6c90458f7b8", "4f48b371-d692-4a79-ad46-a9159dfdd672", "748a2ab3-8b5f-4d0a-9e2d-af685089843a", "870d11c0-8636-4f9a-b265-1016474bebff", "b4022bac-a157-4a3a-9cab-050b7c5a49c3", "c9c5a9c0-f1b7-4286-8538-13476ae32e60"], "title": "Adaptive Spatial Modulation Using Huffman Coding", "venue": "global communications conference", "year": 2016, "id": "0a13520f-b058-43ff-ad3b-5e292422887e"}						
{"abstract": "Semantic image segmentation is a fundamental task in image understanding. Per-pixel semantic labelling of an image benefits greatly from the ability to consider region consistency both locally and globally. However, many Fully Convolutional Network based methods do not impose such consistency, which may give rise to noisy and implausible predictions. We address this issue by proposing a dense multi-label network module that is able to encourage the region consistency at different levels. This simple but effective module can be easily integrated into any semantic segmentation systems. With comprehensive experiments, we show that the dense multi-label can successfully remove the implausible labels and clear the confusion so as to boost the performance of semantic segmentation systems.", "authors": ["Tong Shen", "Guosheng Lin", "Chunhua Shen", "Ian D.

{"abstract": "This paper focuses on modeling ride requests and their variations over location and time, based on analyzing extensive real-world data from a ride-sharing service. We introduce a graph model that captures the spatial and temporal variability of ride requests and the potentials for ride pooling. We discover these ride request graphs exhibit a well known property called densification power law often found in real graphs modelling human behaviors. We show the pattern of ride requests and the potential of ride pooling for a city can be characterized by the densification factor of the ride request graphs. Previous works have shown that it is possible to automatically generate synthetic versions of these graphs that exhibit a given densification factor. We present an algorithm for automatic generation of synthetic ride request graphs that match quite well the densification factor of ride request graphs from actual ride request data.", "authors": ["Abhinav Jauhri", "Brian Foo", "Jerome Berclaz", "Chih Chi Hu", "Radek Grzeszczuk", "Vasu Parameswaran", "John Paul Shen"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["1079e0ff-5b82-466a-8a4d-888070e0fbd2", "24861225-3105-4832-addb-a546909650b0", "58600378-8e31-4103-8feb-69f2d3f97606", "68faab18-b537-4f62-85cf-ddc9ef352362", "713ca1b9-71b6-48e9-bcf3-156b6dcae8f4", "e7f6b8b1-4fdc-48df-876f-67859ed4d5cf", "f75e49b7-bd64-41a1-bba4-b744c67ba062"], "title": "Space-Time Graph Modeling of Ride Requests Based on Real-World Data", "venue": "arXiv: Artificial Intelligence", "year": 2017, "id": "0a94673d-9653-4c2a-bfee-e7f7bd41cb46"}
