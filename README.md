Performing Mapreduce on Dataset using Hadoop and Python.
Attached is a dataset "dblp-ref-vershort.json" on which the mapper and reducer programs work.
All the programs are writted in Python programming language.

mapper4.py and reducer4.py are used to determine the research paper which was referenced the most and the count on how many times it was referenced.

mapper5.py and reducer5.py are used to determine the top 5 research papers which were referenced the most and the count on how many times they were referenced.

mapper6.py and reducer6.py are used to determine the author who was a part of most research papers and the count of how many research papers the author was a part of.

mapper7.py and reducer7.py are used to determine top 5 authors who were a part of most research papers and the count of how many research papers the authors were a part of.
